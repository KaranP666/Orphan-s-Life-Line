					<p>For the past 21 years, Miracle Foundation has improved the lives of more than 15,000 orphaned and vulnerable children at more than 300 orphanages in India.

To accomplish this, we developed our revolutionary Thrive Scale™ methodology  based on 5 well being domains and the UN Rights of the Child. This tool allows us to collect and track data across a wide spectrum of health and wellness factors to give every child the chance to reach their full potential. 

After years of on-the-ground experience and careful analysis, we are turning our expertise from orphanages to families and leading a global movement to bring children home whenever possible. We’re also training the social workforce on alternatives to orphanage care, reaching into communities to strengthen Child Protections Committees at the local level, incentivizing youth and identifying vulnerable families long before the need for child placement arises.

We’re also applying our technology and measurement skills to the US Foster Care System, connecting families to vital services through an easy-to-use app and streamlining the complex reporting requirements  that  foster families face.

Miracle Foundation is an international nonprofit for children, headquartered in Austin, Texas with offices in New York City and New Delhi. 

We believe in collaboration as we know this work is bigger than any one organization. We are part of a global network of nonprofit organizations leading the worldwide movement to end the need for orphanages in our lifetime.
